\section{How to use this template}
This is a free template for bachelor or master theses.\section {directory structure}

The actual contents of the thesis is placed at the directory: \texttt{chapter}. A separate file shall be created in the directory for each chapter. The separate chapters can then be integrated into a one file main.tex

Images should be uploaded to the \texttt {images} folder.


\subsection{Reference management}
References can be defined in Latex with \texttt {.bib} files and integrated into the running text with the command \texttt {\textbackslash {} cite} \cite {iuk696}. 

A reference management program makes the whole thing much easier, however, as it allows sources to be automatically imported, conveniently managed and cataloged.
