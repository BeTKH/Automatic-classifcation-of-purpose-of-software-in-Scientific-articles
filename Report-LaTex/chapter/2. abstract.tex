Abstract
}


In the traditional sense, the term typography refers to the design of printed works with movable letters (types). Initially, this was done in lead typesetting or wood typesetting.

In media theory, typography stands for printed type in contrast to handwriting (chirography) and electronic as well as non-literal texts.

Today, typography usually refers to the media-independent design process that uses type, images, lines, surfaces and empty spaces to create all kinds of communication media. In contrast to calligraphy, writing or type design, typography is the design with found material.
