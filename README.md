## Master Thesis: Automatic Classification of purpose of Software Usage Statements from Scientific Articles

A master thesis project aimed at developing automated methods for extracting the purpose of software usage in scientific papers.  

The project involved identification of types of software tools used in scientific research, annotating a text dataset with BRAT text annotation tool, identification of suitable classifier algorithms, classification with BERT/Sci-BERT/Bio-BERT, analysis, and visualization of results.

### Implementation steps:

1. Identification of Software category labels & suitable algorithms
2. Annotation of text dataset
3. Data Cleaning and transformation to I-O-B format
4. Text Classification and visualization of results.
