# Scientific Text Classification with BERT
Master's Thesis Project

### Project Overview

This project focuses on automating the classification of scientific text using advanced BERT-based models, including Bio-BERT and Sci-BERT. The primary goal is to identify and categorize the purpose of software or tools mentioned in scientific research papers.

To achieve this, a set of scientific texts is manually labeled using the BRAT text annotation tool. The annotated data is then leveraged along with pre-trained BERT models to automatically classify the texts based on their content.

### Implementation Steps
Define software categories and identify appropriate classification algorithms.
Annotate the dataset using the BRAT text annotation tool.
Clean and transform the data into the I-O-B format for model compatibility.
Perform text classification and visualize the results for better insights.
